This app is used to gather NCAA Divsion I teams, rosters, and game results 
and write them out to a MySQL database. A site to present the data is also 
included, but stil in the very early stages of development.

I am currently in the middle of a rewrite of this code and adding a very basic UI to it. The master
branch will remain dormant for now and development will occur on the rewrite branch.
