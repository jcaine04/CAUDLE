CAUDLE
======

College Analytics... something... we're still working on the acronym.

CAUDLE is named after legendary Xavier F/C Will Caudle. CAUDLE is used to gather 
NCAA Divsion I teams, rosters, and game results and write them out to a MySQL 
database. A site to present the data is also included, but stil in the very early stages
of development.

I am currently in the middle of a rewrite of this code and adding a very basic UI to it. The master
branch will remain dormant for now and development will occur on the rewrite branch.
